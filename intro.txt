I hope you're all doing well today. My name is Raj Kumar Singh, and I'm currently interning at Genpact as an MDM intern here in Bengaluru. Over the past two months, this experience has been nothing short of amazing. Not only have I gained valuable skills, but I've also had the opportunity to meet new people and explore this vibrant city. Alongside my internship at Genpact, I am currently pursuing my BTech degree at NIET, GR Noida. Throughout this period, I actively participate in hackathons, like the Smart India Hackathon, winning competitions like IOTRON organized by the Institutions Innovation Council (IIC), and sports events. I've also worked as a team Android team lead for Google Development Student Club, which contributes to shaping my college life into an exhilarating journey of exploration and self-development. I come from a nuclear family, consisting of my parents, my younger sister, and myself, I've always been surrounded by love and support. Family has been my pillar of strength throughout my life. now talking about my strenght One of my key strengths lies in my solid work ethic. I don't just aim to meet deadlines; I strive to surpass them by completing projects well ahead of schedule. Additionally, I pride myself on being adaptable, allowing me to quickly acclimate to new environments and challenges. taking about my greatest weakness that comes to mind is multitasking. As I mentioned earlier, I follow solid work ethics, and sometimes, to meet deadlines or finish my work early, I engage in multitasking. However, this can sometimes lead to incomplete work. I am aware of this flaw of mine, and I am actively working on it. When I have some time, I try to focus on picking one task at a time rather than multitasking. Additionally, I am continuously improving my time management skills. Looking ahead, my aspirations revolve around becoming an expert in data analysis and master data management. I also aim to take on leadership roles where I can mentor others and make a positive impact through my work. Whether it's contributing to innovative solutions or projects with social and environmental benefits, I'm committed to leaving a meaningful mark. Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I'm excited to continue growing both personally and professionally on this journey.
