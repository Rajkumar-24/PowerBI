Subject: Request for Temporary Relocation Due to College Examinations

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to inform you that our university examinations are scheduled to take place from 25 May to 27 May. Due to certain college priorities related to external practicals, we are requesting to leave one or two weeks prior to the examinations. This time is crucial for us as we need to focus on our Final Year Project and make travel arrangements.

It's important to note that we are not requesting leaves but rather a temporary relocation to manage our college commitments effectively while also fulfilling our responsibilities at Genpact.

Attached to this email, you will find the schedule for the External Practical, University Exam Schedule, and the OHR IDs of the interns requesting the temporary relocation.

Thank you for considering our request.

Regards
