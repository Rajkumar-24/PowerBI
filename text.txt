Subject: Request for Temporary Relocation Due to College Examinations

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to inform you that our university examinations are scheduled to take place from 25 May to 27 May. Due to certain college priorities related to external practicals, we are requesting to leave one or two weeks prior to the examinations. This time is crucial for us as we need to focus on our Final Year Project and make travel arrangements.

It's important to note that we are not requesting leaves but rather a temporary relocation to manage our college commitments effectively while also fulfilling our responsibilities at Genpact.

Attached to this email, you will find the schedule for the External Practical, University Exam Schedule, and the OHR IDs of the interns requesting the temporary relocation.

Thank you for considering our request.

Regards




Good afternoon, Ram,

I hope this message finds you well. Yesterday, Rajiv Sir discussed our situation with you, and you also received an email regarding this. I just want to know when we can go back for our exam and what's the plan after that. Can we finish the rest of our internship in Noida? It's tough and costly to travel back and forth in two weeks. Can you let us know soon? We need to book train tickets. Thanks a lot for your help.


Hello Danish and Shampa,

I hope this message finds you both well.

We wanted to follow up on our previous email dated 23 April regarding temporary relocation due to university exams. Natasha has kindly confirmed the leave and granted approval. However, a final confirmation is required from both of you. 

With only a month remaining for the duration of the internship, we are writing to inquire if it would be possible to work the rest of our internship from Noida. Traveling back for just a month would be costly, considering the arrangements needed such as accommodations, rent, and PG security.

Please connect with us at your earliest convenience to discuss and address the situation. Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Best regards
